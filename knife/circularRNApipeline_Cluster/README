** Before attempting to run, follow INSTALL directions to configure and test your installation.

** There are a total of 10 possible parameters, the first 5 are required and
defaults for the rest are described in the main project README. Keep in mind that since this is a
shell script the arguments are positional. This means that if you wanted to use
default value for argument 6 but wanted to specify a different value for
parameter 7, you still need to call the script with the default value for
argument 6 specified.

** see README on main project page for details on each of these parameters

## USAGE
##########################

If you are using a SLURM scheduler, you will run findCircularRNA_SLURM.sh and if
you are using a Sun Grid Engine scheduler you will run findCircularRNA_SGE.sh.
The code produces the same results, the only difference is scheduler-specific syntax.
References below to findCircularRNA***.sh refer to either of these files.

You must cd into circularRNApipeline_Cluster and run the script findCircularRNA*.sh
from within the directory so that all relative paths will work.

A complete analysis using these wrapper scripts to submit jobs to the scheduler requires 
calling findCircularRNA***.sh 3 times, altering the “mode” parameter each time.

  1) The first run generates the annotation-dependent reports, alignment statistics,
     and creates the de novo index for this dataset using read 1 (R1) junction alignments only.
     
     sh findCircularRNA***.sh read_directory read_id_style alignment_parent_directory dataset_name
     junction_overlap mode report_directory_name ntrim denovoCircMode junction_id_suffix

  2) For the second run, use all the same parameters from the first run but append
     the string "_unaligned" to the mode. This generates the de novo reports by aligning
     unaligned reads to the de novo index created for this dataset during the first run. 
     This step also uses R1 junction alignments only.

     sh findCircularRNA***.sh read_directory read_id_style alignment_parent_directory dataset_name j
     unction_overlap mode_unaligned report_directory_name ntrim denovoCircMode junction_id_suffix

  3) For the third run, use all the same parameters from the first run but append
     the string “_R2analysis” to the mode. This will re-run the annotation-dependent and de novo
     analysis (steps 1 and 2) looking for all R2 junction alignments this time. Note that this step 
     was not performed for the results presented in the publication, we only considered R1 junction 
     alignments. Consolidated reports counting alignments from both R1 and R2 will be output under
     alignment_parent_directory/dataset_name/report_directory_name/combinedReports.

     sh findCircularRNA***.sh read_directory read_id_style alignment_parent_directory dataset_name
     junction_overlap mode_R2analysis report_directory_name ntrim denovoCircMode junction_id_suffix

See main project README file for parameter descriptions and default values. In addition
to the possible values for the "mode" parameter described in the project README,
you can also append "_large" to the mode to request additional resources when submitting
jobs to the scheduler. If you find that some of your samples run fine but others do not,
a good first step in troubleshooting is to rerun in the "large" mode (you can also confirm
this by querying the scheduler to see how much memory and time your job ended up using).
