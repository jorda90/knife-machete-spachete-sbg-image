## usage
[julia@Protista testing]$ perl process_representatives_for_lindas_pipeline.pl >test_fasta_lindas_pipeline.fa screen

## screen is a USER input such as "denovo_fetal_circle". Ultimate output is a bowtie2 index with the name screen
## considerations:  ALL junctions (linear or circular) are denoted by REV 
## pipeline has implicit parameters like a threshold on psum, the statistic that defined 'real-ness' which can be changed if needed
## originally, used lower bound on difference in bin sizes because otherwise (this can be changed in a script specific way in the file process_max*
## as input into Linda's pipeline, bin boundaries should be given "slack" up to 50 nt on each side for rounding that takes place in script
## bin size is 50, could be changed, but global search should be performed on all scripts
## total numbers and unique numbers are computed as described below
## ways the counts in the ultimate header output are computed is given below.
## ultimate output is hs_denovo_input.fa
## READS SHOULD BE TRIMMED as input.
## the script imposes a uniform lower bound on # reads passing the threshold to be put into the denovo pipeline, which I have set to 2; remapping should correct this hard threshold
## Note: since a denovo junction can cross multiple bins, there could be more than one bin id representing a junction
 
## FINAL OUTPUT IS:  hs_denovo_input_onlycircles0.fa for the purposes of the fetal paper

## from teststats_2c, numtot is number of total reads, numberdiff is number of distinct (start,stop)/2, myn is number of distint start,stops, which could be 2*totalreadnumber

my $numberdiff= numunique(@mystarts); # numberdiff could be between 2 and 2*numtot below
$numtot=scalar(@mystarts)/2; ## number of unique (start,stops), cannot exceed read totals.

 $header=">".$numtot."__".$strand."_".$chrom."_".$bin1."_".$bin2."_psum_".$mypsum."_nseq_".$myn."_numberdiff_".$numberdiff."_";
this header goes into lindaoutputetst

## current script removes chrM junctions


## details of process_directory* 


## rest of commands are run on entire directory:
system ("perl further_process.pl ".$screen. ">denovo_".$screen);
## renames files properly
system ("mv lindaOUTPUTEST fasta_for_".$screen);
system ("perl process_representatives_for_lindas_pipeline.pl fasta_for_".$screen." > hs_denovo_".$screen);
system ("perl process_max_denovo.pl hs_denovo_".$screen." > hs_denovo_input.fa")
