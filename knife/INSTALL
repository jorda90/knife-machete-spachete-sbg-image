1. Download most recent version of code. You will only need 1 of these 2 directories
and can delete the other which you will not be using:
  
  circularRNApipeline_Cluster for running on cluster using Sun Grid Engine or SLURM scheduler
  circularRNApipeline_Standalone for running on a single machine

Notes below referring to circularRNApipeline_*** are referring to either circularRNApipeline_Cluster 
or circularRNApipeline_Standalone, whichever you are using
  
2. make sure all R, python, and shell scripts are executable
  
3. Install the following software and add to $PATH

    Bowtie2 2.2.1+ (tested with 2.2.1)
    Bowtie 0.12.7+ (tested with 0.12.7)
    perl
    python 2.7.3+ (tested with 2.7.5) and the numpy and scipy libraries
    R 3.0.2+ (tested with 3.0.2) and the data.table package
    samtools 1.2+ if you want alignment files output as bam instead of sam files

3b. (only if necessary)
  
  In some cases I have run into issues getting all of the software correctly in my $PATH when running
  on a cluster without actively loading modules just before making a call to one of the programs.
  I created 2 files that provide a workaround for this that you can modify if it is easier for you.
  Example code is provided showing how I had to use it, if you modify to suit your needs it
  will then be called in all the correct places in the code.
  
  circularRNApipeline_***/depends.sh can be used to load Bowtie2, python, R, and samtools into your path
  
  circularRNApipeline_***/denovo_scripts/depends.sh can be used to load perl, Bowtie, and Bowtie2 into your
  path for creating the denovo index
    
4. Install bowtie indexes:

  a. create index directories circularRNApipeline_***/index and circularRNApipeline_***/denovo_scripts/index
  
  b. download available indexes

  Annotated junction indices are available for Human (hg19), Mouse (mm10), Rat (rn5) and Drosophila (dm3).
  We have also packaged up all of the the transcriptome, genome, and ribosomal index, fasta, and gtf files
  for each of these genomes named as required for use with our scripts. You will need to unpack the Bowtie2 
  tar (use: tar zxvf genomeId_BT2index.tar.gz) and the fastas tar (use: tar zxvf genomeId_fastas.tar.gz) 
  into circularRNApipeline_*/index. You will need to unpack the Bowtie1 tar (use: tar zxvf genomeId_BT1index.tar.gz) 
  into circularRNApipeline_*/denovo_scripts/index. The gtf file must be downloaded and uncompressed 
  (gunzip genomeId_genes.gtf.gz) into the circularRNApipeline_*/denovo_scripts directory.

5. Follow directions in testOutput/README to test installation.
